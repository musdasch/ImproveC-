# ImproveC++
It's a repository for my C++ skill training.

## Programs
You will find the programs in the src folder.

### Child
The Child program is a loop that will ask you why until you typed stop.

### CToF
A program with cout and cin. The program convert celsius to fahrenheit.

### Exactly
This program is a example for accuracy with float numbers. The results s1 and s2 should be the same but computer arithmetic has some inaccuracies. for improvement of the accuracy you have to order the sums and add the smallest number first.

### Fibonacci
The Fibonacci program displays the fibonacci sequence.It starts with a chosen number and ends after a defined length. First you define the number to start with after you define the number of passes.
 
### HelloWorld
As usual a hello world program for basic understanding.

### Limits
This program outputs all limits from trivial data types. ( at this time the most )

### MathExpert
This program is a example for math functions in the cmath library.

### Overflow
This program multiply tow numbers together so that they exceeded the limit and displays the result.

### Summe
It is a program to calculate tow numbers together.

### ForLoop
It uses a for loop.
